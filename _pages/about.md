# 👨‍🎓 About Me

I am currently a Ph.D. student at Medical Robotics Lab, [State Key Laboratory of Multimodal Artificial Intelligence Systems](https://mais.ia.ac.cn/), [Institute of Automation](https://ia.cas.cn/), Chinese Academy of Sciences, advised by [Prof. Zeng-Guang Hou](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~houzengguang) and [Prof. Guotao Li](https://ia.cas.cn/rcdw/fyjy/202409/t20240913_7362784.html). I got my bachelor’s degree in June 2023 from the Department of Automation, China University of Petroleum (East China), advised by [Prof. Weifeng Liu](https://www.scholat.com/liuweifeng). My research interest includes human-robot interaction, reinforcement learning and exoskeleton robot control.

My research will focus on [Cobodied AI](http://scis.scichina.com/cn/2025/SSI-2024-0219.pdf), which aims to achieve profound alignment between robotic and human cognition, as well as human-centered efficient environmental interaction and feedback. Specifically, the goal of my research is to ensure that exoskeleton robots can provide efficient and personalized assistance across diverse environments and for varied users. I am exploring accurate human intent and motion preference recognition, and human-environment-adaptive robot interaction learning methods.
